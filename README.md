# Health and Fitness App
This application will help users track their workouts, set fitness goals, manage daily meals, engage in health challenges, gain or lose weight, and monitor their overall progress. The project is designed to develop a comprehensive mobile and web application so that users can stay connected with interactive features. The primary objective is to effectively manage individual health and fitness journeys.

The Health and Fitness App provides users with a platform to log their daily workout routines, track calories burned, and set fitness targets. The application offers visual representations of progress and encourages users to stay committed to their health goals. It also helps users refine workout routines and make informed decisions for their well-being.

The application implements robust Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure secure user access. Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints, making the system reliable and safe for personal health data management.
